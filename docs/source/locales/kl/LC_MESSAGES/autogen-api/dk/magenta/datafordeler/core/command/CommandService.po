"Created by lars on 29-05-17. Webservice that receives commands on POST "
"requests, checks job status on GET requests, and cancels jobs on DELETE "
"requests. The basic idea is that a POST request will parsed, and if "
"successful, a row will be put in the Command table. GET requests will "
"look at the table and return the job status DELETE requests will find the"
" associated job in the table and attempt to cancel it"
