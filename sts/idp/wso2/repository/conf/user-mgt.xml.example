************* Description of some of the configuration properties used in user-mgt.xml *********************************

DomainName -
    This property must be used by all secondary user store managers in multiple user store configuration.
    DomainName is a unique identifier given to the user store. Users must provide both the domain name and
    username at log-in as "DomainName\Username"

UserRolesCacheEnabled -
    This is to indicate whether to cache role list of a user. By default it is set to true.
    You may need to disable it if user-roles are changed by external means and need to reflect
    those changes in the carbon product immediately.

ReplaceEscapeCharactersAtUserLogin -
    This is to configure whether escape characters in user name needs to be replaced at user login.
    Currently the identified escape characters that needs to be replaced are '\' & '\\'

UserDNPattern -
    This property will be used when authenticating users. During authentication we do a bind. But if the user is login
    with email address or some other property we need to first lookup LDAP and retrieve DN for the user.
    This involves an additional step.  If UserDNPattern is specified the DN will be constructed using the pattern
    specified in this property. Performance of this is much better than looking up DN and binding user.

RoleDNPattern -
    This property will be used when checking whether user has been assigned to a given role.
    Rather than searching the role in search base, by using this property direct search can be done.

PasswordHashMethod -
    This says how the password should be stored. Allowed values are as follows,
        SHA - Uses SHA digest method
        MD5 - Uses MD 5 digest method
        PLAIN_TEXT - Plain text passwords
        In addition to above this supports all digest methods supported by http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html.

DisplayNameAttribute -
    This is to have a dedicated LDAP attribute to display an entity(User/Role) in UI, in addition to the UserNameAttribute which is used for IS-UserStore interactions.
